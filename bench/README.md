# Lem Performance Ledger

This is the perf ledger for SPEC-PERF — the analogue of `verified/README.md` for
the verified kernel. It records baselines, rebaselines, and every optimization
(OPT-n) with before/after numbers. The field data (T0) is the arbiter; synthetic
wins that do not move the T0 histograms are recorded as such.

## Layout

```
bench/
├── README.md      # this ledger
├── baselines/     # committed, per-machine baselines (<fingerprint>-<tier>.json)
├── results/       # gitignored: per-run result JSON
├── profiles/      # gitignored: sb-sprof flat/graph reports (PF-6)
└── corpora/       # committed fixed corpora / deterministic generators (PF-4/5)
```

## Running

```bash
scripts/run-bench.sh t1                 # measure + gate against baseline
scripts/run-bench.sh --rebaseline t1    # regenerate the baseline (needs a ledger entry)
scripts/bench/self-test.sh              # prove the gate catches a regression
```

Baselines are per-machine. Every result carries a fingerprint (hostname + CPU
model + core count) and comparisons only run against a matching fingerprint
(Constraint 5). Measurement is median of five in-process repetitions with a full
GC before each timed section and the first repetition discarded (Constraint 5).
A gated-tier regression beyond the per-entry noise band blocks commit like a red
test (Constraint 3).

## Result schema (`lem-bench`, one schema for all tiers)

```json
{
  "fingerprint": "host | cpu model | Nc",
  "tier": "t1",
  "commit": "<git rev>",
  "timestamp": "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS",
  "entries": [
    {"name": "telemetry", "unit": "us/op",
     "min": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "p90": 0.0,
     "consed-per-op": 0, "n": 1000000}
  ]
}
```

Baseline files additionally carry a per-entry `"band"` (noise band as a
fraction; measured as the spread of medians over five suite runs at baseline
creation, floored at 5%). Regression = current median worse than baseline median
by more than the band.

## T1 entries

| Entry | What it measures | Budget |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| telemetry | PF-1 record path (`histogram-record`, inline hot-path primitive) | < 1 µs/op and 0 bytes consed/op (Constraint 4, permanent) |

More T1 entries (edit, width, search, syntax, redisplay, points) land in PF-4.

## Ledger

Format: one row per baseline creation / rebaseline / OPT-n. Include the
fingerprint, the commit, the reason, and — for optimizations — before/after
numbers and the motivating T0/T2 measurement (Constraint 1).

### Rebaselines

| Date | Fingerprint | Tier | Commit | Reason |
|------|-------------|------|--------|--------|
| 2026-07-18 | ex44 / i5-13500 / 20c | t1 | (PF-3) | Initial baseline: `telemetry` entry established with the bench runner. No optimization — this is the substrate landing (SPEC-PERF PF-3). |

### Optimizations (OPT-n)

_None yet. P5 must not start before the P4 grounding report (SPEC-PERF)._

| Item | Date | Evidence (T0/T2 + profile) | Change | Before → After | Notes |
|------|------|----------------------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| —    | —    | —                          | —      | —              | —     |
